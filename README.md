Contains the files for 

1. The original base code developed by Weatherhead et. al (2011) using Netlogo version 4.1. 
2. The modified code which includes automating the model, modelling different NB-UVB treatment frequencies (e.g. 3-times, 5-times weekly) with a reduced MED from the original model, modelling both mechanisms of action for psoriasis clearance (apoptosis and cell cycle arrest) and excluding weekends during NB-UVB treatment to mimic opening hours of clinics.
